## Project Plan

The goal of this project is to create a practical solution for optimizing CI/CD workflows. Industry costs for runners can rack up quickly if they are left running constantly. I read that it is more cost-efficient to have AWS host the runners using **EC2 Spot Instances** that die after a job is done. I am currently evaluating whether to use **containers** for this implementation, so the final architecture is still being decided.

I mainly wanted to do this project because I think resume projects should solve a problem that is actually faced in the job you are going for. It shouldn't just be a project that shows you know the services, but one that shows you know how to figure out problems and work with the services in the context of the role.

## Tools
- Terraform
- AWS
- Github actions
- Linux
- Docker (if i go the container route)
- JS / Node.js for lambda
- Maybe some Bash
